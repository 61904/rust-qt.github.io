This is an example of using [ritual](https://github.com/rust-qt/ritual) to generate Rust bindings for a C++ library. The [clipper](http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php) library is used as an example.

Note: this project doesn't attempt to create a fully featured bindings for `clipper`. This is only a basic example.
