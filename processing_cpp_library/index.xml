This will also help your future contributors.
Ritual provides a Dockerfile containing its dependencies. This image is published at riateche/ritual_builder. If the published version isn&amp;rsquo;t suitable, you can build the image locally:
cd ritual docker build . -f docker.builder.dockerfile -t riateche/ritual_builder Use this image as a base and create your own image that installs and sets up the C++ library you want to work with.</description></item><item><title>Running generator</title><link>https://rust-qt.github.io/processing_cpp_library/running_generator/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rust-qt.github.io/processing_cpp_library/running_generator/</guid><description>Creating the generator Create a new binary Rust crate and add ritual as a dependency. In the main function, you need to construct a ritual::config::GlobalConfig and pass it to ritual::cli::run_from_args. GlobalConfig allows you to process multiple libraries (or parts of a library as separate crates) in a single run, but in the simple case it just contains a function that creates a Config for your library.
Config is the main way of configuring ritual.</description></item></channel></rss>
